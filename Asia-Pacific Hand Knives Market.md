This growth is particularly evident in countries with rapidly expanding digital economies. Furthermore, the increasing use of mobile devices and apps to make purchases has contributed to the rise of mobile e-commerce, expanding the customer base and enhancing the overall convenience of purchasing hand knives. Retailers and manufacturers are capitalizing on this trend by offering special deals, loyalty programs, and more user-friendly websites to attract a larger audience.

Furthermore, many consumers prefer to buy from trusted local shops that provide expert advice and can offer a more personalized shopping experience.
